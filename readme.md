# NES-RS
A simple Nintendo Entertaining System emulator written in pure rust.
**This project is a work-in-progess!!**

## Why?
I want to gain insight into the inner workings of the NES, and this project is a part of my research. In addition to that, I seek to learn more about the Rust programming language, and this project is a golden opportunity to achieve that goal.

## Progress
So far I have only began working on emulating the [Obelisk 6502 chip instructions](https://www.nesdev.org/obelisk-6502-guide/reference.html).
Here you can see how many have already been implemented:
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>ADC🟩</td>
		<td>AND🟩</td>
		<td>ASL🟩</td>
		<td>BCC🟩</td>
		<td>BCS🟩</td>
		<td>BEQ🟩</td>
		<td>BIT🟩</td>
		<td>BMI🟩</td>
		<td>BNE🟩</td>
		<td>BPL🟩</td>
		<td>BRK🟩</td>
		<td>BVC🟩</td>
		<td>BVS🟩</td>
		<td>CLC🟩</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>CLD🟩</td>
		<td>CLI🟩</td>
		<td>CLV🟩</td>
		<td>CMP🟩</td>
		<td>CPX🟩</td>
		<td>CPY🟩</td>
		<td>DEC🟩</td>
		<td>DEX🟩</td>
		<td>DEY🟩</td>
		<td>EOR🟩</td>
		<td>INC🟩</td>
		<td>INX🟩</td>
		<td>INY🟩</td>
		<td>JMP🟩</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>JSR🟩</td>
		<td>LDA🟩</td>
		<td>LDX🟩</td>
		<td>LDY🟩</td>
		<td>LSR🟩</td>
		<td>NOP🟩</td>
		<td>ORA🟩</td>
		<td>PHA🟩</td>
		<td>PHP🟩</td>
		<td>PLA🟩</td>
		<td>PLP🟩</td>
		<td>ROL🟩</td>
		<td>ROR🟩</td>
		<td>RTI🟩</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>RTS🟩</td>
		<td>SBC🟩</td>
		<td>SEC🟩</td>
		<td>SED🟩</td>
		<td>SEI🟩</td>
		<td>STA🟩</td>
		<td>STX🟩</td>
		<td>STY🟩</td>
		<td>TAX🟩</td>
		<td>TAY🟩</td>
		<td>TSX🟩</td>
		<td>TXA🟩</td>
		<td>TXS🟩</td>
		<td>TYA🟩</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Additionally, the chip shipped with certain unofficial opcodes that were left unused by design. However, some games still use these undocumented operations, so I am going to implement them for the sake of completeness. You can see the progress on that here:
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>AAC🟩</td>
		<td>AAX🟩</td>
		<td>ARR🟩</td>
		<td>ASR🟩</td>
		<td>ATX🟩</td>
		<td>AXA🟥</td>
		<td>AXS🟥</td>
		<td>DCP🟥</td>
		<td>DOP🟩</td>
		<td>ISC🟥</td>
		<td>KIL🟥</td>
		<td>LAR🟥</td>
		<td>LAX🟥</td>
		<td>NOP🟩</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>RLA🟥</td>
		<td>RRA🟥</td>
		<td>SBC🟥</td>
		<td>SLO🟥</td>
		<td>SRE🟥</td>
		<td>SXA🟥</td>
		<td>SYA🟥</td>
		<td>TOP🟩</td>
		<td>XAA🟥</td>
		<td>XAS🟥</td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Goals
My grandest goal is that of building a greater understanding of NES and its inner workings, as well as deepening my knowledge of Rust.
That wouldn't be possible without having a set path in mind, so I've decided that by the end of this learning experience I want to have an emulator capable of running the "Super Mario Bros".

I am following the afformentioned documents in order to learn about NES and Rust. This research wouldn't have come to fruition without these.
