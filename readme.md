# NES-RS
A simple Nintendo Entertaining System emulator written in pure rust.
**This project is a work-in-progess!!**

## Why?
I want to gain insight into the inner workings of the NES, and this project is a part of my research. In addition to that, I seek to learn more about the Rust programming language, and this project is a golden opportunity to achieve that goal.

## Progress
So far I have only began working on emulating the [Obelisk 6502 chip instructions](https://www.nesdev.org/obelisk-6502-guide/reference.html).
Here you can see how many have already been implemented:
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>ADC游릴</td>
		<td>AND游릴</td>
		<td>ASL游릴</td>
		<td>BCC游릴</td>
		<td>BCS游릴</td>
		<td>BEQ游릴</td>
		<td>BIT游릴</td>
		<td>BMI游릴</td>
		<td>BNE游릴</td>
		<td>BPL游릴</td>
		<td>BRK游릴</td>
		<td>BVC游릴</td>
		<td>BVS游릴</td>
		<td>CLC游릴</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>CLD游릴</td>
		<td>CLI游릴</td>
		<td>CLV游릴</td>
		<td>CMP游릴</td>
		<td>CPX游릴</td>
		<td>CPY游릴</td>
		<td>DEC游릴</td>
		<td>DEX游릴</td>
		<td>DEY游릴</td>
		<td>EOR游릴</td>
		<td>INC游릴</td>
		<td>INX游릴</td>
		<td>INY游릴</td>
		<td>JMP游릴</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>JSR游릴</td>
		<td>LDA游릴</td>
		<td>LDX游릴</td>
		<td>LDY游릴</td>
		<td>LSR游릴</td>
		<td>NOP游릴</td>
		<td>ORA游릴</td>
		<td>PHA游릴</td>
		<td>PHP游릴</td>
		<td>PLA游릴</td>
		<td>PLP游릴</td>
		<td>ROL游릴</td>
		<td>ROR游릴</td>
		<td>RTI游릴</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>RTS游릴</td>
		<td>SBC游릴</td>
		<td>SEC游릴</td>
		<td>SED游릴</td>
		<td>SEI游릴</td>
		<td>STA游릴</td>
		<td>STX游릴</td>
		<td>STY游릴</td>
		<td>TAX游릴</td>
		<td>TAY游릴</td>
		<td>TSX游릴</td>
		<td>TXA游릴</td>
		<td>TXS游릴</td>
		<td>TYA游릴</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Additionally, the chip shipped with certain unofficial opcodes that were left unused by design. However, some games still use these undocumented operations, so I am going to implement them for the sake of completeness. You can see the progress on that here:
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>AAC游릴</td>
		<td>AAX游릴</td>
		<td>ARR游릴</td>
		<td>ASR游릴</td>
		<td>ATX游릴</td>
		<td>AXA游린</td>
		<td>AXS游린</td>
		<td>DCP游린</td>
		<td>DOP游릴</td>
		<td>ISC游린</td>
		<td>KIL游린</td>
		<td>LAR游린</td>
		<td>LAX游린</td>
		<td>NOP游릴</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>RLA游린</td>
		<td>RRA游린</td>
		<td>SBC游린</td>
		<td>SLO游린</td>
		<td>SRE游린</td>
		<td>SXA游린</td>
		<td>SYA游린</td>
		<td>TOP游릴</td>
		<td>XAA游린</td>
		<td>XAS游린</td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Goals
My grandest goal is that of building a greater understanding of NES and its inner workings, as well as deepening my knowledge of Rust.
That wouldn't be possible without having a set path in mind, so I've decided that by the end of this learning experience I want to have an emulator capable of running the "Super Mario Bros".

I am following the afformentioned documents in order to learn about NES and Rust. This research wouldn't have come to fruition without these.
